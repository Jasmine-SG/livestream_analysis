# From Passion to Profit: Exploring Emotions as Indicators of Monetized Message Engagement

This study explores the intersection of rule-based matching and audience engagement analysis within YouTube live streaming, focusing on the identification of emotions in live chat interactions. As live streaming gained unprecedented popularity, understanding audience behavior and sentiment became crucial for content creators, platforms, and marketers. This research particularly examines Super Chat messagesâ€”monetized interactions that potentially indicate higher emotional investment from viewers. By applying a combination of rule-based matching and machine learning, this paper aims to classify chat messages, both regular and monetized, based on expressed emotions within the language. The hypothesis is that Super Chat messages display more emotions, thus differentiating them from regular interactions. Findings from this analysis will provide insights into how emotional resonance can influence viewer engagement and monetization strategies, offering valuable implications for enhancing online content delivery and audience satisfaction in a competitive digital landscape.
