1:10:01 | GreenLittleApple: you always want to hold back by default
1:10:02 | (Member (2 months)) Meepers Morpus: you downback if they are aiming low
1:10:02 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: only if you're blocking lows
1:10:04 | (Member (2 months)) muxperienceYT: downback only if you anticipate a low
1:10:04 | Shashumga: its best to fuzzy duck
1:10:06 | Summer2shura: read or react to a low i guess
1:10:07 | 7down8up: treat mids like getting hit by a GG dust

1:10:33 | (Member (1 month)) Nezumi: if you block a low sweep it usually leaves them wide open
1:10:33 | John Bao: Normal Back defends High and Mid, and gets hit by Low. Down Back defends Low and gets hit by Mid.
1:10:40 | (Member (2 months)) MTLxSpider: yes but lows usually do little damage or are negative on hit
1:10:40 | imun_: Honestly, just don't block low, you'll understand when you need to the more you play

4:03:31 | (Member (2 months)) XingYuu√º: nc
4:03:33 | (Member (1 month)) Tavi Says: it also flips 
4:03:34 | Seeker Scorpio: if you go to command list you can view the move to see what it looks like 
4:03:38 | Ed: perfect frame will have an electric crackle after the hit
4:03:41 | Izendale: is the frame perfect version indicated by dorya?
4:03:47 | Mm: p2 is better for electrics but p1 is better for backdash etc
4:03:53 | dangdangle: lmao
4:03:55 | Manny_916: EWGF
4:04:02 | ThunderCraker12: if im not wrong she can do df3 into 2 no?
4:04:10 | ThunderCraker12: or was it f3 into 2
4:04:18 | (Member (2 months)) Mox: ew girlfriends lol
4:04:19 | Shashumga: instead of trying to do electrics practice the wave dash first
4:04:22 | MrMarnel: directions need to be faster together
4:04:24 | mako_: try leaving like half a second before df
4:04:28 | MrMarnel: try the directions without the button
4:04:30 | Mm: you wil
4:04:32 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: lol
4:04:34 | (Member (2 months)) edoge14: LMAO

4:05:07 | Mm: that's the mixup and yes they will
4:05:07 | Seeker Scorpio: yeah the demonstration not only shows the move, but it shows you the pacing of how to press the buttons
4:05:08 | (Member (2 months)) muxperienceYT: power move
4:05:09 | (Member (2 months)) daichi!: yeah LOL
4:05:10 | Shashumga: practice doing f n df f first
4:05:12 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: forward qcf 2
4:05:12 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: you dont need it to start. you can practice it as you go
4:05:13 | (Member (2 months)) CFMG: :_viviHeh:
4:05:14 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: thats fine
4:05:14 | ThunderCraker12: tap f>wait for half a sec>then go df2
4:05:15 | Manny_916: you can practice just doing the wave dash part first. you'll see her feet spark.
4:05:17 | Mm: the DORYA sends fear into the spines of new players
4:05:19 | MrMarnel: forward, let go, down, slide finger to down+forward
4:05:21 | Gonzalo: just like the wavedash
4:05:28 | Mm: wavu will give you the input you need 
4:05:29 | Izendale: what happens if you try to do a traditional dragonpunch input?
4:05:41 | dangdangle: she's doin it
4:05:43 | MrMarnel: yeah she should be doing that crouch animation
4:05:44 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: that little duck
4:05:47 | Mm: that is 
4:05:47 | Chimkin Scratches: the way panda's head is tracking you xD
4:05:48 | Gonzalo: that is the mishima step yeah
4:05:48 | ThunderCraker12: ur kinda doing it
4:05:49 | (Member (2 months)) „Ç®„É¨„ÉÜ„É≥: that's it yeah
4:05:49 | kreyanov: ohh
4:05:50 | Seeker Scorpio: when your character goes forward and ducks their head = wave dash
4:05:52 | Nekial: yes that's the waveu
4:05:54 | Mm: yes when you chain them it's wavus
4:05:54 | kreyanov: there it is
4:05:56 | MrMarnel: that little duck is what you want
4:05:56 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: wave dash is when you chain the ducking dashes like that really quickly
4:05:58 | Shashumga: that forward sway thing is a wavedash
4:06:01 | dangdangle: yes
4:06:03 | ThunderCraker12: yes when she ducks her head
4:06:03 | Mm: if you do it right you'll see the spark
4:06:06 | Manny_916: yeah the spark is a wave dash
4:06:06 | (Member (2 months)) CFMG: yea
4:06:06 | Seeker Scorpio: when they quickly duck it looks like a wave
4:06:12 | Nekial: little zap sound is the wavedash
4:06:15 | Mm: do it and spark in succession and it's working
4:06:20 | kreyanov: yep
4:06:20 | (Member (2 months)) „Ç®„É¨„ÉÜ„É≥: mixups
4:06:23 | MrMarnel: the move comes out of that wavedash
4:06:24 | Seeker Scorpio: some moves require wave dashing
4:06:29 | Mm: it's a flex and mix up starter for speed
4:06:29 | (Member (2 months)) Shardykar: mixups yeah
4:06:32 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: its pressure, those characters have mixup options that come out of that stance
4:06:34 | (Member (2 months)) CFMG: :_viviPien:
4:06:36 | ThunderCraker12: its how you can use the EWGF
4:06:37 | Manny_916: after you wave dash then press 2
4:06:39 | Shashumga: wavedash then press 2 to do wing god fist
4:06:42 | Yuna Ogura Marry ( c∆∞·ªõi ) L∆∞u Trung D≈©ng: :hydrate::hydrate::hydrate::hydrate::hydrate:

4:07:17 | (Member (2 months)) „Ç®„É¨„ÉÜ„É≥: :_viviHeh:
4:07:23 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: :_viviHeh:
4:07:23 | Gonzalo: pick hwoarang and backdash ezpz
4:07:24 | (Member (2 months)) Shardykar: it's just a wavedash in the opposite direction

4:07:29 | (Member (2 months)) Shardykar: sorta
4:07:29 | Blastcity: on hitbox hold back, tap down let go, tap forward let go
4:07:30 | MrMarnel: back-back-down+back-back repeat
4:07:30 | kreyanov: damn you‚Äôre already thinking that lol
4:07:30 | (Member (2 months)) Tvanon: :_viviHeh:

4:07:36 | Mm: ye just wavu backwards 
4:07:36 | Manny_916: B B DB B
4:07:38 | Miles Gloriosus: back, down-back, then back again
4:07:38 | Shashumga: b,b, db, b, db, and so on it needs to be clean inputs
4:07:38 | (Member (2 months)) Sura: :_viviHeh:
4:07:44 | Mm: try the other side for kbd
4:07:50 | (Member (2 months)) Mox: back dash but korean
4:07:52 | ThunderCraker12: too close
4:07:55 | ThunderCraker12: i think
4:08:02 | MrMarnel: nah distance doesn't matter
4:08:05 | (Member (2 months)) muxperienceYT: you need the neutral
4:08:05 | Seeker Scorpio: you're pretty much flicking forward to wave dash gotta let the stick sit back in the middle
4:08:10 | Mm: because your wavus aren't clean enough, try pressing forward after a wavu as you input the next wavu
4:08:19 | Shashumga: try f n df f
4:08:28 | Manny_916: you need the neutral input
4:08:32 | Mm: pad/keybaord makes it easier
4:08:34 | Miles Gloriosus: you cancel the crouch dash with a forward input, then continue with another crouch dash, that's the wavu wavu
4:08:36 | Gaming Nights - NeoMasaki: Ooh, nice leverless
4:08:37 | Blastcity: hold back, tap down let go, tap forward let go
4:08:38 | ThunderCraker12: she just needs to get used to the timing
4:08:39 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: It's even better
4:08:40 | Mm: you can skip the neutral input
4:08:43 | Gonzalo: there is a little pause
4:08:43 | ThunderCraker12: just tap
4:08:44 | Manny_916: F N D DF
4:08:47 | Miles Gloriosus: let go of your stick
4:08:50 | Miles Gloriosus: that's the neutral input
4:08:51 | Miles Gloriosus: yes
4:08:52 | (Member (2 months)) muxperienceYT: imagine your inputs are moving a stick, you need to let up on forward to let the stick go neutral
4:08:52 | MrMarnel: neutral is just a pause without inputs
4:08:52 | (Member (2 months)) daichi!: yeah let go
4:08:53 | Seeker Scorpio: with keyboard, i have no idea, i feel it'll be a timing learning
4:08:54 | Mm: yeah just spam it a bnch for a feel
4:08:55 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: neutral on leverless is just no direction being pressed
4:08:57 | Ed: yea
4:08:58 | Blastcity: hitbox lets you cheat
4:09:00 | (Member (2 months)) Shardykar: yeah there's a blank input on the left side you can see it
4:09:00 | Mm: try getting it one at a time 
4:09:07 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: she did it
4:09:12 | Gaming Nights - NeoMasaki: Neutral on leverless can be no direction of left and right at the same time
4:09:12 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: you had it for a second
4:09:14 | Mm: that's it
4:09:22 | MrMarnel: don't let go of the down, hold it then press forward for down+forward
4:09:24 | Mm: dw they mader it easier but it takes time
4:09:25 | Gaming Nights - NeoMasaki: Or*
4:09:26 | ThunderCraker12: dont worry its kinda the harder techs
4:09:33 | ThunderCraker12: just need to get used to it
4:09:35 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: you dont want to sidestep, you might be hitting the down input for too long
4:09:38 | Mm: not harder but def required
4:09:41 | Mm: for a mishima
4:09:41 | Shashumga: try doing it slowly
4:09:45 | Miles Gloriosus: oh shit Majin Obama is here
4:09:49 | (Member (2 months)) Mox: you might be side stepping too much
4:09:53 | Manny_916: oh damn majin obama is here :waving_hand:

4:10:21 | Shashumga: that was it
4:10:27 | Mm:  F df f f
4:10:28 | Shashumga: that crouching sway
4:10:28 | Gaming Nights - NeoMasaki: That was it
4:10:31 | Seeker Scorpio: try the see the demo of the move. it shows you the tempo of what to press and what it looks like. the tempo learning is important
4:10:33 | L': don't sidestep.
4:10:34 | (Member (1 month)) „Ç®„Ç≠„Éô„É≥/Rizeben: lets gon vikky
4:10:36 | MrMarnel: yeah that

4:10:45 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: Nice
4:10:46 | (Member (1 month)) Antigono: Just like real martial arts. you have to practice it a 1000 times
4:10:48 | Mm: (press 2 at the end)
4:11:02 | Manny_916: you want to press 2 the same time you press DF
4:11:05 | Mm: dw take it slow you can do wavus with a delay
4:11:08 | kreyanov: yea nws its not easy
4:11:11 | Ron: forward > neutral > 236 > forward then so on
4:11:22 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: nice
4:11:24 | (Member (2 months)) azn31: Yoo she's getting the rhythm 
4:11:27 | Mm: correct
4:11:28 | Shashumga: yup but thats a start
4:11:29 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: that was it, but not just frame
4:11:30 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: some stuff you just have to feel out, and when you nail it once or twice you will "get it." dont get discouraged
4:11:30 | (Member (2 months)) daichi!: closer
4:11:35 | Gaming Nights - NeoMasaki: Woot! That‚Äôs a start
4:11:36 | (Member (1 month)) MSY: lol

4:11:38 | (Member (1 month)) „Ç®„Ç≠„Éô„É≥/Rizeben: its a start
4:11:39 | MrMarnel: that was it, just not perfect
4:11:40 | ThunderCraker12: amen
4:11:42 | Miles Gloriosus: the electric should launch the Panda
4:11:46 | Mm: it's weaker but works
4:11:54 | (Member (2 months)) Majin Obama: close
4:11:58 | Mm: and you're only missing the next ff input after the delayed neutral timing
4:12:01 | Miles Gloriosus: into the stratosphere
4:12:01 | ThunderCraker12: oh that kinda
4:12:04 | Manny_916: close

4:15:47 | mako_: got an achievement for beating up panda :eyes-purple-crying:
4:15:59 | MrMarnel: if you double-tap down the game tries to sidestep so you gotta not leg go of down
4:16:04 | n0pants: you can do it with her left foot too 
4:16:05 | Mm: if you think it's bad now though jsut wait until you try adn get an elctric from wavu lmao
4:16:13 | yol: become a cheatbox abuser and do electrics with ease
4:16:18 | Mm: ^
4:16:19 | L': Practice your wave dash. That's what you need to do to get consistent electrics.
4:16:21 | Mm: or kb

4:17:07 | Seeker Scorpio: down+hold down
4:17:12 | MrMarnel: yeah, see at the command list how there's two down inputs with a gap between them, that's what's wrong
4:17:13 | ThunderCraker12: ?
4:17:16 | Manny_916: hold it down
4:17:23 | Mm: speed
4:17:30 | Shark Kev: dont worry takes time so doing practice its going to be your best tool
4:17:33 | Envyz: Piece of advice speed does not matter for ewgf your failing because your inputting too fast and your also experiencing some inaccuracies because you‚Äôve been doing the same movement repeatedly
4:17:35 | Mm:  ^

4:17:57 | Mm: speed for perfect does matter but a delayed electric and wavu inputs fin
4:18:16 | (Member (2 months)) EnvyMizuhashi: Mashing 2 doesn't help either
4:18:47 | Seeker Scorpio: yeah mashing 2 is going to throw it off too. gotta be confident with the single press
4:18:49 | Shashumga: you can display the input in game

4:20:55 | Shashumga: you can in the inputs if the df and 2 are on the same frame thats when it does the elctric
4:20:58 | Izendale: you might just need to let it sit overnight
4:20:59 | (Member (1 month)) CD-i Link: X
4:21:01 | Mm: oh we should note for the regular wind god fist you can do it with botht eh special style and on the end of a wave dash
4:21:09 | (Member (2 months)) Memers: Good, don't be that gamer
4:21:27 | Mm: the same frame is a perfect electric
4:21:41 | Mm: you can doa regluar electric with a large delay
4:21:56 | (Member (2 months)) Mox: if you activate heat, all your wgf become electric automatically during heat
4:21:57 | Izendale: you might be rushing your 2?
4:22:02 | Xcythe: That's :down_right_arrow: + 2
4:22:03 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: if you wanna see what it looks like, do it in heat mode
4:22:14 | ThunderCraker12: oh right
4:22:19 | ThunderCraker12: heat mode makes it ez mode
4:22:19 | Mm: THAT'S IT
4:22:24 | MrMarnel: that's right, just not perfect
4:22:28 | Mm: now that witha faster 2 is a electric
4:22:37 | mako_: if youre in heat its always electrics 
4:22:41 | sendu‚öò: wheres duh electirc
4:22:42 | Mm: and a same frame is a perfect electric
4:22:45 | (Member (2 months)) EnvyMizuhashi: Notice how you end up doing quarter circles. For you to WGF, that Forward at the end doesn't exist.
4:22:46 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: Oh there you go
4:22:46 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: that's it
4:22:48 | Mm: W
4:22:54 | (Member (1 month)) Antigono: Im starting to feel sorry for the panda...
4:23:02 | (Member (2 months)) clearplasticcups: it's always perfect in heat
4:23:05 | Shashumga: you can start just practicing with normal wgf and slowly get to electrics just get consistent first
4:23:09 | Mm: it's the same input as wavedash and korean backdash is also teh same input but backwards
4:23:14 | (Member (2 months)) Cyouni: panda is starting to look a little beat up
4:23:34 | Izendale: does the parser read the last f if she does all inputs correctly up to the df+2 part?
4:23:36 | (Moderator) cherry: panda's seen some shit
4:23:39 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: Panda is in need of a shower too

4:23:58 | Miles Gloriosus: nah panda deserves it
4:24:06 | ThunderCraker12: its ok vivi just get used to the motion
4:24:08 | Mm: if you get a regular godfist it's too slow yeah
4:24:12 | Bak Kiu Tse: try holding after the last DF
4:24:15 | (Member (2 months)) Angus MacGyver: panda being tired for being a punching bag
4:24:19 | (Member (2 months)) YourPetRock: Ghost is just here for emotional support 
4:24:30 | (Member (1 month)) MSY: Can't wait for Tekken 9 lol
4:24:34 | (Member (2 months)) EnvyMizuhashi: Yes
4:24:35 | Mm: yes
4:24:40 | MrMarnel: check the input list after a failed one, the correct sequence should be forward, empty, down, down+forward+2
4:24:51 | Mm: if you want an easier electric that you can delay though try pressing 2 when you press down
4:24:54 | Mm: NICE
4:24:56 | (Member (2 months)) daichi!: yippee !!!
4:24:57 | ThunderCraker12: ayo sparks
4:25:03 | (Member (2 months)) Cyouni: Panda: why am I here, just to suffer
4:25:16 | Airo Wultx: What I do for Reina's EWGF is I do Forward - neutral - and then Down Foward + 2 at the same time
4:25:23 | Jonathan Vue: inputting forward during the wave dash will cancel the dash, have to be careful there
4:25:24 | Izendale: oh yeah it looks like you're letting go of down on a lot of your failed attempts (where you get the forward)
4:25:27 | (Member (2 months)) kish: never let go of down 
4:25:27 | n0pants: if you get d2 you're pressing 2 too early, if you get df2 you're pressing it too late
4:25:34 | Xcythe: I'm using a keyboard, the way I do it was tap :right_arrow:, pause for a bit, then roll your D,DF by pressing :down_arrow:, then press :right_arrow: while holding :down_arrow:
4:25:36 | Mm: You did
4:25:37 | (Member (2 months)) Jojora: You did
4:25:39 | (Member (2 months)) EnvyMizuhashi: Baby steps

4:25:41 | (Member (2 months)) Tvanon: yeap
4:25:43 | Nekial: if I remember correctly downforward+2 instantly is still usable on Reina, no need to input down
4:25:44 | (Member (2 months)) YourPetRock: We have it on record
